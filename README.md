## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm TenebrisOS, a beginner developer. I mainly use Python, C, and Dart to create cool programs. Iâ€™m looking forward to learn other programming languages, primarily Rust for low-level memory safety and java.
I currently use dart more than anything else and most of my time, i work on [Nots](https://github.com/TenebrisOS/Nots)
